Amazon Product and Sales Analysis Dashboard

Hi everyone! I’m excited to share my latest project: a dashboard designed to analyze sales and product data in a more interactive and insightful way. 

Here’s What I Did:

Cleaned and Prepped the Data:

Worked on cleaning and organizing the data to ensure everything was accurate and ready for analysis.

Created Powerful DAX Measures:

Built measures to handle both simple and complex calculations.

Added features like combining sales and units with check icons for clarity.

Designed dynamic titles that update based on the selected filters for better context.

Dashboard Highlights:

This dashboard is divided into three interactive pages:

1. Overview
A snapshot of overall sales performance.
You can filter by category, shipping status, and toggle between sales or units for a clearer picture of trends.

2. Product Analysis
Focused on specific products within a chosen category.
Displays product images, names, and key metrics like sales, units, reviews, and returns.
Tooltips offer quick insights, including sales trends for each product.

3. Product View (Deep Dive)
A more detailed look at individual product performance.
Includes a date slider to zoom into sales trends and other metrics for specific timeframes.

Why It’s Useful:

Intuitive Design: Dynamic features like slicers, tooltips, and date sliders make it easy to explore data without being overwhelming.

Actionable Insights: Helps businesses track product performance, shipping outcomes, and sales trends for better decision-making.
